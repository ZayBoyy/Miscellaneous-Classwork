# Miscellaneous-Classwork
This is simply an online copy of various classwork I have completed throughout my CS education path

CS 2450 was Software Engineering. I created a Unity Game with my classmates to implement a development cycle model
CS 2810 was Computer Organization and Structure. I worked with MIPS Assembly, learned about logic blocks and more.
CS 3000 was Advanced Algorithms and Structures. Here I learned about more algorithms, and how one can optimize their code.
CS 3150 was C and C++ Programming. I learned about the different capabilities, limitations, and quirks of C and C++, and how to use it effectively.
CS 3550 was Theory of Computation. I learned about what problems are computable, and how to make sure the computations are efficient.
CS 3600 was Operating Systems. I learned about how Operating Systems work, how they communicate with user-level applications, and how to make use of the tools given by the OS.
